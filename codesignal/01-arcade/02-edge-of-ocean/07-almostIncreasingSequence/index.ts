 * Problem: Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
 * Note: sequence `a0, a1, ..., an` is considered to be a strictly increasing if `a0 < a1 < ... < an`. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.
 * Example:
 *  For `sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false`
 *    There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.
 *  For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be `almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true`
 *    You can remove `3` from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence `[1, 2]`.
 *    Alternately, you can remove `2` to get the strictly increasing sequence `[1, 3]`.
